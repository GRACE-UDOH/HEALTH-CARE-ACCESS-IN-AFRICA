### Project Overview

Using Power BI, this project visualizes healthcare facility data to compare funding patterns, response times, and efficiency across rural and urban settings, offering clear insights for informed policymaking.

### Project Objectives

1.	Compare the number and types of healthcare facilities in urban vs. rural regions.
2.	⁠Analyze funding allocations across locations and facility types.
3.	⁠Examine the relationship between funding levels and emergency response times.
4.	⁠Evaluate funding efficiency using cost per patient visit.
5.	⁠Provide strategic recommendations for more equitable healthcare distribution.

### Key Insights

1.	Emergency response times remain high, with health centers experiencing the longest delays.
2.	⁠Rural areas receive more funding than urban ones, but gaps in infrastructure and specialist availability persist.
3.	⁠Funding per patient visit is balanced, yet inefficiencies in resource allocation impact service quality.
4.	⁠Rural areas have more doctors, but urban regions may have better-equipped facilities.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1.	Government healthcare funding should focus on placing medical facilities strategically in rural areas to cut down travel time and make essential services easier to reach.
2.	Investing in stable power and internet will boost rural health centers’ services and enable telemedicine.
3.	Offering incentives like housing and allowances can attract and keep healthcare workers in remote communities.
